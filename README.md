# Path-Finding-and-Collision-Detection
The Environment is a randomly generated grid with a user-defined probability of each cell being an obstacle or not. Implemented Local Search algorithms like Breadth First Search and Depth First Search to create an AI bot that navigates its way through this environment in order to reach the goal node .Used the A* Algorithm with Euclidean and Manhattan distance based heuristics to improve the time and space complexity . Used a Genetic algorithm to generate progressively harder mazes and benchmarked their performance and summarize the results
